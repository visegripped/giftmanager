giftmanager
===========

A simple gift management solution for those of us that are tired of getting three copies of Batman for Christmas.


9/24 - where I left off on auth.
 * server side implementation is done.
 * client side API call to verify is done.
 * client side callback after successful auth is done.
 * Need auth failure handler.
 * Need to hide add form till after auth.

#To do:
* The API needs a refactor.
* Get cmds renamed using CRUD.
* Get files renamed using new ^ CRUD naming syntax - they should match.
* user authentication.
* ---itemList needs to default to the authenticated user.---
